            <p>Ableton was founded in 1999 and released the first version of Live in 2001. Our products are used <br> by a community of dedicated musicians, sound designers, and artists from across the world.</p>

            <p>We feel the same way about making Ableton products. The driving force behind Ableton is our <br> passion for what we make, and the people we make it for.</p>

            <p>Most of us are active musicians, producers, and DJs, and many of us use Live and Push every day. <br> We come from a wide range of cultural and professional backgrounds. Some of us have PhDs, <br> some are self-taught, and most of us are somewhere in between. What connects us is the shared <br> belief that each of us has the skills and knowledge to contribute to something big: helping to shape <br> the future of music culture.</p>

            <p>Rather than having a one-size-fits-all process, we try to give our people what they need to work <br> their magic and grow. We’ve learned that achieving the best results comes from building teams <br> that are richly diverse, and thus able to explore problems from a wider set of perspectives. We <br> don’t always agree with each other, but opinion and debate are valued and openly encouraged.</p>

            <p>Alongside an internal training program, employees are actively supported in acquiring new knowledge <br> and skills, and coached on applying these in their daily work. In addition, staff-organized development <br> and music salons are a chance to discuss new technologies, production techniques and best practices.</p>

            <p>If you're joining us in Berlin, we'll help with relocation and paperwork. We’ll even provide you with free <br> German or English lessons. Plus, working in Germany means you can expect comprehensive health <br> insurance for you and your family, as well as generous maternity and paternity leave. Office hours are <br> flexible, but it’s not all work; we have several company and team outings throughout the year as well as <br> a variety of fun, informal small-group activities.</p>
